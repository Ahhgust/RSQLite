Configuration failed because redland was not found. Try installing:
 * deb: librdf0-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)
 * rpm: redland-devel (Fedora, EPEL)
 * brew: redland (OSX)
If redland is already installed, check that 'pkg-config' is in your
PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH contains a redland.pc file. If pkg-config
is unavailable you can set INCLUDE_DIR and LIB_DIR manually via:
R CMD INSTALL --configure-vars='INCLUDE_DIR=... LIB_DIR=...'
